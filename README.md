# Machine Learning and Data Science Tasks for Academic Requirements

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook tasks that I have completed as part of my academic requirements. These notebooks cover a range of machine learning algorithms and techniques, including classification, regression, time series forecasting, and natural language processing (NLP). The tasks are intended to demonstrate my understanding and practical application of these methods.
